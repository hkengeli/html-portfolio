<h1>The Best Movies According to TWGibidem</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The invention of lying</h3>
<p>Such a good plot and strange 'what-if'-scenario.</p>
<h3>A man called Otto</h3>
<p>Hollywood remake of a Swedish film ("A man called Ove"). Tom Hanks<br />
plays the leadrole as a lonely and desperate man.</p>
<h3>Begin again</h3>
<p> Good songs and a nice dreamy plot about an aspiring musician. Will<br/>
she make it or not??</p>
